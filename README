Options

  -v|--version    - Emit rvm version loaded for current shell
  -l|--level      - patch level to use with rvm use / install
     --prefix     - path for all rvm files (~/.rvm/), with trailing slash!
     --bin        - path for binaries to be placed (~/.rvm/bin/)
     --source     - src directory to use (~/.rvm/src/)
     --archives   - directory for downladed files (~/.rvm/archives/)
  -S              - Specify a script file to attempt to load and run (rubydo)
  -e              - Execute code from the command line.
  -G              - root gem path to use
  --gems          - Used to set the 'gems_flag', use with 'remove' to remove gems
  --archive       - Used to set the 'archive_flag', use with 'remove' to remove archive
  --patch         - With MRI Rubies you may specify one or more full paths to patches
                    for multiple, specify comma separated:
                    --patch /.../.../a.patch[%prefix],/.../.../.../b.patch
                    'prefix' is an optional argument, which will be bypassed
                    to the '-p' argument of the 'patch' command. It is separated
                    from patch file name with '%' symbol.

                    options then append them comma separated: -C --...,--...,--...
  --nice          - process niceness (for slow computers, default 0)
  --ree-options   - Options passed directly to ree's './installer' on the command line.

  reload    - reload rvm source itself (useful after changing rvm source)
  implode   - (seppuku) removes the rvm installation completely.
              This means everything in $rvm_path (~/.rvm).
              This does not touch your profiles, which is why
              there is an if around the sourcing scripts/rvm.
  update    - upgrades rvm to the latest version.
              (If you experience bugs try this first with --head)
  reset     - remove current and stored default & system settings.
              (If you experience odd behavior try this second)
  info      - show the *current* environment information for current ruby
  debug     - show info plus additional information for common issues

  wrapper   - generates a set of wrapper executables for a given ruby with the

  srcdir    - display the path to rvm source directory (may be yanked)

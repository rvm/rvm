# Example ~/.rvmrc file.
#
# This file shows some examples of setting defaults to your own tastes.
#
# If you wish to adjust the default ruby interpreter/version/patchlevel
# settings they can be found in the $rvm_path/config/db file.
# Beware that currently that file is overwritten on install so
# back it up if you change anything.

# RVM path
#   This is where rvm installs and manages everything in by default.
#
# export rvm_path="$HOME/.rvm"

# Source path
#   This is where rvm extracts to for compiling & installing.
#
# export rvm_source_path="${rvm_path}/src"

# Log path
#   This is where rvm logs all of it's actions to
#   (not including the 'do' actions)
#
# export rvm_log_path="${rvm_path}/log"

# Bin path
#   This is where rvm places all of it's executable/wrapper scripts.
#
# export rvm_bin_path="${rvm_path}/bin"

# Gem path
#   This is where rvm installs all gems to for each ruby
#   interpreter/version%gemset
#
# export rvm_gems_path="$rvm_path/gems"

# Gem options
#   These options are passed to the 'gem' command in a RVM environment.
#
# export rvm_gem_options="--no-rdoc --no-ri"

# Temp path
#   This is where rvm stores all of its temporary files.
#
# export rvm_tmp_path="${rvm_tmp_path:-"$rvm_path/tmp"}"

# Install on use
#   Install rubies when used if are not installed.
#
# export rvm_install_on_use_flag=1

# Gemset create on use
#   This will create a gemset when the gemset is used if it does not exist
#
# export rvm_gemset_create_on_use_flag=1

# Make flags
#   I have 8 cpu's so I might use 7 make threads:

# export rvm_make_flags="-j7"

# Source a .rvmrc file in a directory after changing to it, if it exists.
# To disable this feature, set in root/home .rvmrc file:
#
# export rvm_project_rvmrc=0
#
# Or don't even bother sourcing rvm, it *is* optional. Always has been, you can
# instead add $rvm_path/bin to your PATH and use --default to switch...

# Automatically trust project .rvmrc files
#
# export rvm_trust_rvmrcs_flag=1

# Always trust an rvmrc, even if it's contents change.
#   CAUTION: Can be dangerous / security risk. Only use this feature if you know
#          what you are doing / accept the implications :)
#
# export rvm_always_trust_rvmrc_flag

# Specify RBXOPT enviroment settings that should always be set when calling
# Rubinius scripts. For example, to always run the agent when running from
# an Rubinius environment, set the value to '-Xagent'
#

# Disable automatic system configuration of RVM via /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh:
#
# export rvm_etc_profile_flag=0

# Add configure flags for builds

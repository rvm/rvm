<h1> Using rvm rubies with Passenger </h1>

<p> rvm will allow you to use any of it's MRI/YARV rubies with passenger very easily. </p>

<h3> Example </h3>

<p>
  Let us say that we have used a custom rvm installed ruby-1.8.6-p369.
  To use this ruby under Passenger with Nginx simply set:
</p>

<code>
passenger_ruby /home/wayne/.rvm/bin/passenger-ruby-1.8.6-p369;
</code>

<p>
  And for Passenger running under Apache set:
</p>

<code>
  PassengerRuby /home/wayne/.rvm/bin/passenger-ruby-1.8.6-p369;
</code>

<p> Where you substitute '/home/wayne/' with your own ~/ and 'ruby-1.8.6-369' with your particular interpreter-version-patchlevel string.</p>

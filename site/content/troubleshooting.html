<h1> Troubleshooting </h1>

<p> Here we will explore common issues and their resolutions.
  Visit me (wayneeseguin) in #rvm on irc.freenode.net and let me help you with any issues and please leave feedback!
</p>

<h2> Before trying any solution below </h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li> Make sure that you are on the latest gem version or git HEAD.  </li>
    <li> make sure that the sourcing of the rvm file occurs last in your profile files.  </li>
    <li> Be sure to be using either bash or zsh, rvm is untested at best in other shells.  </li>
</p>

<h2>After selecting a ruby, rubygems is still showing the system default.</h2>
<p>
  Most commonly this is due to RUBYOPT.
  rvm attempts to disable it during installation however you may need to manually disable RUBYOPT while installing a ruby.
  Check the ~/.rvm/log/[ruby you are installing]/rubygems.install.error.log to see if this might be the case.
</p>

<h2> My path seems empty / curl not found </h2>
<p>
  This is most often due to your environment being jacked up when you call rvm so that the wrong system defaults get recorded.
  Remove ~/.rvm/current and ~/.rvm/default*, open a new terminal shell and use rvm to select a ruby.
</p>

<h2> When in doubt... </h2>
<p>
  If all else fails 'rvm implode' then 'rvm update'
  If this still does not resolve your particular issue, please visit me (wayneeseguin) in #rvm on irc.freenode.net
</p>

<h2>Readline </h2>
<ul>
  <li> If you have an error when compiling pertaining to readline, you may need to attempt installing with the following configure option:<br/>

<code>
rvm install 1.9.1 -C --enable-shared=true,--with-readline-dir=/usr/local
</code>
    Note that this error seems to occur when having a macports installed readline along your path.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2> i_can.has? iconv => false # => ?! </h2>
<p>
  If you have issues with iconv not being available in ruby / irb please try the following configure option:
</p>
<code>
  rvm {install|use} {selector} -C --enable-shared=true,--with-iconv-dir=/usr/local
</code>
<p>
  Where you replace '/usr/local' with the prefix where your iconv libraries are.
  Thanks to Justin Chen for this doosey!

<h2> curl failing, 'curl is' ?! </h2>
<p> If you see this: </p>
<code>
++ curl is /opt/local/bin/curl -O -L -s -C - ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.6-p383.tar.gz
curl: Remote file name has no length!
curl: try 'curl --help' or 'curl --manual' for more information
</code>
<p> Then maybe you have aliased or symlinked the 'which' command to the 'type' command, revert this and rvm should work.</p>

<h1> rvm FAQ & Notes </h1>

<p>This page is simply documenting common concepts and questions that have come up on irc. </p>

<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
  <li> rvm is intended to be run as an individual user (not as root, yet) </li>
  <li>rvm must be included at the bottom of the profile files. Otherwise your settings will clobber it's (example: PATH)</li>
  <li> In order to set a ruby version as default when you open new shells, pass --default when doing the 'rvm use' command.</li>
  <li> Currently spaces in paths is not supported. Patches welcome :)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Defaults</h2>
<ul>
  <li> <em>The last ruby version 'used' becomes the default.</em> </li>
  <li> The default implementation (interpreter) is 'ruby' </li>
  <li> The default version of ruby is '1.8.6' </li>
</ul>

<h2>Gems</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Ruby Gems for 1.9.*, jruby, ree are all separate, while with 1.8.X they are shared.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
  <li> *Everything* is installed into ~/.rvm. To remove rvm from your system simply remove ~.rvm. </li>
  <li>
    The gem is only used for distribution, you can just as easily clone the github repo and run bash/rvm-install or bash/rvm-update.
    After installation the Gem is no longer necessary and can be safely removed.
    This also means that you can clone the repository locally and symlink ~/.rvm/bin/rvm to the cloned project bash/rvm file.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Mac OS X</h2>
<ul>
  <li> If you have an error when compiling pertaining to readline, you may need to attempt installing with the following configure option:<br/>

<code>
rvm install 1.9.1 -C --enable-shared=true,--with-readline-dir=/usr/local
</code>
    Note that this error seems to occur when having a macports installed readline along your path.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2> Netbeans </h2>

<p> Thanks to our friendly mr-interweb on IRC:</p>
<blockquote>
13:46 mr-interweb: Netbeans was detecting the wrong gem root
<br/>
13:48 mr-interweb: Just a FYI in case other people have problems with Netbeans, Netbeans does not allow you to type in a path. You must browse to the path, but it will not show you hidden folders. So, you must create symbolic links like "ln -s ~/.gem ~/gem"

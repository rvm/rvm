<h1> rvm FAQ & Notes </h1>

<h2>Can I run rvm as root?</h2>
<p> rvm is intended to be run as an individual user, not as root (yet) </p>

<h2> rvm is not found, why? </h2>
<p> rvm must be included at the bottom of the profile files. Otherwise your settings will clobber it's (example: PATH)</p>

<h2>Can I use a path with spaces?</h2>
<p> Currently spaces in paths is not supported. Patches welcome :)</p>

<h2>How do I set a ruby to be default?</h2>
<p>Seting the default ruby is <a href="/setdefault">explained here</a>.

<h2> What are the defaults. </h2>
<p>
  The default implementation (interpreter) is 'ruby'.  The default versions for each ruby implementation are:
  <ul>
    <li> ruby: 1.8.6 </li>
    <li> jruby: 1.3.1 </li>
    <li> rubinius: current head </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</ul>

<h2>Where are Ruby Gems kept?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Ruby Gems for all installed ruby interpreters and versions are stored completely separate.
    Gems are located in ~/.rvm/gems/$interpreter/$version.
    Gems can be additionally separated using <a href="/gemsets">Gem Sets</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Where is everything installed to ?</h2>
<p>
  rvm installs everything into ~/.rvm. To remove rvm from your system simply remove ~.rvm.
  You may have one additional config file in ~/.rvmrc and of course the rvm hook in your bash/zsh startup files.
</p>
<h2>Do I need the gem after I install rvm?</h2>
<p>
  No, the gem is only used for distribution, you can just as easily clone the github repo and run bash/rvm-install or bash/rvm-update.
  After installation the Gem is no longer necessary and can be safely removed.
  This also means that you can clone the repository locally and symlink ~/.rvm/bin/rvm to the cloned project bash/rvm file.
</p>

<h2> How do I get my rvm set default Ruby to work with TextMate? </h2>

<p>
Chris: I just spent an hour looking into this, lol. TextMate is a pain in the ass in this regard. Basically it didn't respect the PATH switches RVM does at all and the TM stance seems to be you need to manually set the PATH in the preferences which is lame IMHO.
</p>

<p> The fix to make it all "just work": </p>

<code>
/Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Support/lib/tm/process.rb
Line 125 becomes: exec("bash -lc '" + cmd.compact.join(" ") + "'")

/Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Bundles/Ruby.tmbundle/Support/RubyMate/run_script.rb
</code>
Add a line before line 37 with:
<code>
  ENV['TM_RUBY'] = nil if ENV['TM_RUBY'] == '/usr/bin/ruby'
</code>

<p>The latter line is to override a bizarre TextMate default that people were complaining about way back in 2006... :P</p>

<h2> How do I get Netbeans to see my Ruby's gems?</h2>

<p> Thanks to our friendly mr-interweb on IRC:</p>
<blockquote>
13:46 mr-interweb: Netbeans was detecting the wrong gem root
<br/>
13:48 mr-interweb: Just a FYI in case other people have problems with Netbeans, Netbeans does not allow you to type in a path. You must browse to the path, but it will not show you hidden folders. So, you must create symbolic links like "ln -s ~/.gem ~/gem"

  Notes for ${version} $release

For MacRuby: Install LLVM first.
For JRuby:  Install the JDK. See http://developer.apple.com/java/download/  # Current Java version \"1.6.0_26\"
For IronRuby: Install Mono >= 2.6
For Ruby 1.9.3: Install libksba # If using Homebrew, 'brew install libksba'

To use an RVM installed Ruby as default, instead of the system ruby:

    rvm install 1.8.7 # installs patch 357: closest supported version
    rvm system ; rvm gemset export system.gems ; rvm 1.8.7 ; rvm gemset import system.gems # migrate your gems
    rvm alias create default 1.8.7

And reopen your terminal windows.

$(tput setaf 2)RVM Group Membership Management$(tput sgr0) - With Multi-User installations, the RVM installer automatically
creates an 'rvm' group which, as the RVM documentation explains, administrators must add the users they wish
to let use the RVM installation to. The call is made in the installer as:

    $(tput setaf 2)sudo dscl . -create /Groups/\$rvm_group_name gid \$gid$(tput sgr0)

wherein RVM creates the gid by checking for the last assigned gid and adding 1. To physicially add a user to
the group, administrators must use:

    $(tput setaf 2)sudo dscl localhost -append /Local/Default/Groups/rvm GroupMembership \$user_name$(tput sgr0)

To check on group membership to the RVM group, administrators would execute the following:

    $(tput setaf 2)rvmsudo dscl localhost -read /Local/Default/Groups/rvm$(tput sgr0)

Pay attention to the GroupMembership and PrimaryGroupID lines. This tells you who is in it, and the GID for the RVM group.
Afterwards, should administrators wish to remove users from the group, they would execute:

    $(tput setaf 2)sudo dscl localhost -delete /Local/Default/Groups/rvm GroupMembership \$user_name$(tput sgr0)
    $(tput setaf 2)sudo dsmemberutil flushcache$(tput sgr0)

This will keep the 'rvm' group, but remove the listed user from it. They can directly delete the rvm group with:

    $(tput setaf 2)sudo dscl . -delete /Groups/rvm && sudo dsmemberutil flushcache$(tput sgr0)

without previously deleting users from the group, as well. This will completely remove the 'rvm' group from the system.
Please note, the call to 'dsmemberutil flushcache' is required on both removal of the user from the group, and/or
removal of the group directly because that membership is still cached locally until either reboot or sync with
Directory Services. Allowing the group membership to stay in the user's 'groups' output does not mean the user is
automatically re-added to the 'rvm' group should the group be subsequently be re-added. This means the user(s) end up
erroneously showing they are part of the 'rvm' group even though they actually are not, if the call to 'dsmemberutil'
is not made. By this we mean the 'groups' command will still show them a part of the 'rvm' group, even if the user
logs out and then back in, due to caching. This applies to Tiger, Leopard, Snow Leopard, and Lion. Previous versions of
the OS such as Cheetah/Puma, and Jaguar used 'nicl', a.k.a NetInfo, and not 'dscl'.

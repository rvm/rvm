${rvm_error_clr:-}Xcode and gcc${rvm_reset_clr:-}:

Right now Ruby requires gcc to compile, but Xcode 4.2 and later no longer ship with gcc. Instead they ship with llvm-gcc (to which gcc is a symlink) and clang, neither of which are supported for building Ruby. Xcode 4.1 was the last version to ship gcc, which was /usr/bin/gcc-4.2.

${rvm_notify_clr:-}Xcode 4.1${rvm_reset_clr:-} and earlier:
- Ruby will build fine.

${rvm_error_clr:-}Xcode 4.2${rvm_reset_clr:-} and later (including Command Line Tools for Xcode):
- If you have gcc-4.2 (and friends) from an earlier Xcode version, Ruby will build fine.
- If you don't have gcc-4.2, you have two options to get it:
 * Install apple-gcc42 from Homebrew
 * Install osx-gcc-installer

  ${rvm_notify_clr:-}Homebrew${rvm_reset_clr:-}:

  If you are using Homebrew, you can install the apple-gcc42 and required libraries from homebrew/dupes:

      brew update
      brew tap homebrew/dupes
      brew install autoconf automake apple-gcc42
      rvm pkg install openssl

  Xcode 4.2+ install or/and Command Line Tools for Xcode is required to provide make and other tools.

  ${rvm_notify_clr:-}osx-gcc-installer${rvm_reset_clr:-}:

  If you don't use Homebrew, you can download and install osx-gcc-installer: https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer.

  ${rvm_error_clr:-}Warning${rvm_reset_clr:-}: Installing osx-gcc-installer on top of a recent Xcode is known to cause problems, so you must uninstall Xcode before installing osx-gcc-installer. Afterwards you may install Xcode 4.2+ or Command Line Tools for Xcode if you desire.

  ** NOTE: Currently, Node.js is having issues building with osx-gcc-installer. The only fix is to install Xcode over osx-gcc-installer.

${rvm_notify_clr:-}RVM Group Membership Management${rvm_reset_clr:-} - With Multi-User installations, the RVM installer automatically
creates an 'rvm' group which, as the RVM documentation explains, administrators must add the users they wish
to let use the RVM installation to. The call is made in the installer as:

    ${rvm_notify_clr:-}sudo dscl . -create /Groups/\$rvm_group_name gid \$gid${rvm_reset_clr:-}

wherein RVM creates the gid by checking for the last assigned gid and adding 1. To physicially add a user to
the group, administrators must use:

    ${rvm_notify_clr:-}sudo dscl localhost -append /Local/Default/Groups/rvm GroupMembership \$user_name${rvm_notify_clr:-}

To check on group membership to the RVM group, administrators would execute the following:

    ${rvm_notify_clr:-}rvmsudo dscl localhost -read /Local/Default/Groups/rvm${rvm_reset_clr:-}

Pay attention to the GroupMembership and PrimaryGroupID lines. This tells you who is in it, and the GID for the RVM group.
Afterwards, should administrators wish to remove users from the group, they would execute:

    ${rvm_notify_clr:-}sudo dscl localhost -delete /Local/Default/Groups/rvm GroupMembership \$user_name${rvm_reset_clr:-}
    ${rvm_notify_clr:-}sudo dsmemberutil flushcache${rvm_reset_clr:-}

This will keep the 'rvm' group, but remove the listed user from it. They can directly delete the rvm group with:

    ${rvm_notify_clr:-}sudo dscl . -delete /Groups/rvm && sudo dsmemberutil flushcache${rvm_reset_clr:-}

without previously deleting users from the group, as well. This will completely remove the 'rvm' group from the system.
Please note, the call to 'dsmemberutil flushcache' is required on both removal of the user from the group, and/or
removal of the group directly because that membership is still cached locally until either reboot or sync with
Directory Services. Allowing the group membership to stay in the user's 'groups' output does not mean the user is
automatically re-added to the 'rvm' group should the group be subsequently be re-added. This means the user(s) end up
erroneously showing they are part of the 'rvm' group even though they actually are not, if the call to 'dsmemberutil'
is not made. By this we mean the 'groups' command will still show them a part of the 'rvm' group, even if the user
logs out and then back in, due to caching. This applies to Tiger, Leopard, Snow Leopard, and Lion. Previous versions of
the OS such as Cheetah/Puma, and Jaguar used 'nicl', a.k.a NetInfo, and not 'dscl'.

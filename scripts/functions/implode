Note you may need to manually remove /etc/rvmrc and ~/.rvmrc if they exist still.
Please check all .bashrc .bash_profile .profile and .zshrc for RVM source lines and delete or comment out if this was a Per-User installation.
Also make sure to remove \`${rvm_group_name:-rvm}\` group if this was a system installation.
Finally it might help to relogin / restart if you want to have fresh environment (like for installing RVM again).

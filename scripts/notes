As of 1.8.0 RVM once again loads .rvmrc files, by default, after asking your
permission to trust it of course.  If you do not wish to be enabled, simply set:
    export rvm_project_rvmrc=0
Within either your /etc/rvmrc or \$HOME/.rvmrc file. This will turn off the
cd/pushd hooks when sourcing the rvm() function into your shell.

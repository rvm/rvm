  ∴ rvm --create 1.9.2@funky

For creating a project .rvmrc file - From within the app's root_dir:

  ∴ rvm --rvmrc 1.9.2@funky

Above commands can be also combined to do it all in one pass:

  ∴ rvm --rvmrc --create use 1.9.2@funky
  Using /home/mpapis/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290 with gemset funky

Do not forget to check the generated .rvmrc file - it contains many useful comments.
Note you must still 'rvm rvmrc trust' the newly created .rvmrc

  * If you have any questions, issues and/or ideas for improvement please
    fork the project and issue a pull request.

  * If you wish to disable the project .rvmrc file functionality, set
    rvm_project_rvmrc=0 in either /etc/rvmrc or ~/.rvmrc.
    then log out and back in.

  * You _must_ read 'rvm requirements' for additional OS specific requirements for
    various rubies, and native-extension gems. Expect failures until those are met!

  * For screen users, please do not forget to read https://rvm.io/workflow/screen/.
    You will need to add 'shell -${SHELL}' to your $HOME/.screenrc to properly load RVM.

  * rvm_trust_rvmrcs has been changed to rvm_trust_rvmrcs_flag for consistency

  * Project rvmrc files are now checked for trust whenever they change, as
    promised by the note displayed during the review process

  * Ruby package dependency list for your OS is given by:
      rvm requirements

  * If you encounter any issues with a ruby 'X' your best bet is to:
      rvm get head && rvm reinstall X

  * If you see the following error message: Unknown alias name: 'default'
    re-set your default ruby, this is due to a change in how default works.

  * after_use and after_cd hook now supports multiple files with after_*_*
    the custom hooks can be easily turned on/off by:
      chmod +x $rvm_path/hooks/after_cd_[hook_name]
      chmod -x $rvm_path/hooks/after_use_[hook_name]

  * If your shell exits on entering a directory with freshly checked out sources
    you should update .rvmrc file, and replace any `exit ` with `return `.

  * If you wish to use RVM in an interactive fashion in other shells
    then place the following line at the end of your shell's loading files
    (.bashrc or .bash_profile for bash and .zshenv for zsh),
    after all PATH/variable settings:

    [[ -s "${rvm_scripts_path}/rvm" ]] && source "${rvm_scripts_path}/rvm"  # This loads RVM into a shell session.

  * On some systems (like Ubuntu) rvmsudo requires following changes to work properly:
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/257616/sudo-changes-path-why

  * To update RVM loading code append '--auto' to 'rvm get ...'

  * In case you have some old RVM files/rubies in '/usr/local/bin' or '$HOME/bin' feel free to remove them,
    they were copied there because of bug in path detection.

  * ZSH 4.3.15 is buggy, be careful with it, it can break RVM, especially multiuser installations,
    You should consider downgrading ZSH to 4.3.12 which has proven to work more reliable with RVM.

  * Optionally you can run \`rvm tools rvm-env ruby bash\` which will generate
    shebang wrappers for easier selecting ruby in scripts.

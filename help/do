∴ rvm all do some-command

Executes arbitrary commands against rvm set operations. If given a set that
matches a single ruby command, it will exec the command directly without printing
out extra rvm information.

Examples:

To execute 'ruby -v' against all installed rubies and aliases, you would run:

  ∴ rvm all do ruby -v

If you instead want to execute it against a specific ruby (without extra logging
/ data printed by rvm as is done with normal set operations), you can instead do:

  ∴ rvm ree do ruby -v

Since it is a set operation, normal ruby specifiers will work. As an example, to run
it against 1.9.2 and 1.8.7, you would run:

  ∴ rvm 1.9.2,1.8.7 do ruby -v

Or, to execute 'gem env' against all gemsets:

  ∴ rvm --with-rubies all-gemsets do gem env

To execute 'which ruby' in the current directory, loading a .rvmrc and falling back
to the default ruby:

  ∴ rvm --with-rubies default-with-rvmrc do which ruby

For more information, look up the rvm set operations.
